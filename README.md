# Sketchbook

This repository is not an active project. If you are looking for maintained,
professional code, look at another repository. This exists for one reason and
one only - to give me a simple place to put coding exercises, proofs-of-concept,
and other "sketches".

Unless noted otherwise, anything of mine here is released under the MIT license.
